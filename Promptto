Got it ‚úÖ ‚Äî you want the prompt rewritten for GitHub Copilot (so it can directly scaffold your Next.js app).
Here‚Äôs a clean, concise Copilot-friendly version of your requirements, structured as coding instructions:


---

Copilot Prompt

Build a Next.js v15.3.3 + React + TypeScript app with:

UI library: shadcn/ui (for header, sidebar, cards, modals, dropdowns, toasts)

Data fetching: TanStack Query

Tables: TanStack Table

Animations: Framer Motion

API calls: Axios (use mock endpoints for now, but code should call APIs via React Query hooks)


Layout

Create a reusable Header with logo (left), theme toggle + profile dropdown (right).

Create a Collapsible Sidebar (icons visible when collapsed) with menus: Dashboard, Applications, OpenShift, Secrets, Configurations, Logs, Monitoring, Audit.

Use a main layout component that includes header + sidebar.


Dashboard Page

Show status cards (OSE Pods, Memory, Repositories, CICD). Fetch data via mock APIs.

Add a CSI filter dropdown.

Show a microservices table with columns:

Name, Type, CSI ID, Environments, Connections (DB, Solace, Kafka, etc.)


Add a ‚ÄúCreate Microservice‚Äù button ‚Üí opens modal, calls mock POST API.

Each row has View/Edit ‚Üí navigates to detail page.


Microservice Detail Page

Fetch data via mock API by ID.

Show sections:

Basic details

Environments list

OpenShift Pod details

ConfigMap details

Connections (Spring, Kafka, DB per cluster) with CRUD (use mock APIs).



Configuration Manager

Add a Cluster selection dropdown (mock API provides list).

On cluster select ‚Üí fetch configs for that cluster (mock API).

Allow CRUD for cluster configs (React Query mutations).

Show Preview panel:

Cluster config (from API)

Combined config across clusters (mock API merge)

YAML syntax highlighting.


Add Export YAML button ‚Üí simulate API download.


Additional

Use shadcn/ui toasts for success/error.

Add global search bar for microservices.

Add skeleton loaders for API fetching.

Make responsive/mobile-friendly.



---

üëâ This way, Copilot will generate a scaffold with:

Layout (Header + Sidebar)

Dashboard page (cards + table)

Microservice details page

Config Manager page (cluster dropdown + YAML preview + export)

API service layer (mock Axios endpoints + React Query hooks)

Would you like me to trim this into a single ‚ÄúCopilot instruction block‚Äù (shorter, inline style) so you can paste it directly into your editor while scaffolding?
