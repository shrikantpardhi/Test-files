I am using Harness Lightspeed.  
I want to define a task YAML file that prepares Helm charts and deploys multiple releases dynamically.

Requirements:
- Task should run in two steps:
  1. Prepare Helm Charts:
     - Read `release_list` from `helm/values.yaml` using `yq`.
     - For each release, create a folder `<release>/helm/`.
     - Copy all common Helm chart files from the `helm/` directory:
       - `Chart.yaml`, `values.yaml`, and other root files.
       - Entire `templates/` folder into `<release>/helm/templates/`.
     - If `<env>-values.yaml` exists (where `<env>` is from variable `HARNESS_ENV`), copy it into `<release>/helm/values.yaml`.  
       Otherwise, use `helm/values.yaml`.
  2. Deploy Helm Releases:
     - Loop through all releases from `release_list`.
     - Run:
       ```
       helm upgrade --install <release> <release>/helm \
         -f <release>/helm/values.yaml \
         --namespace ${HARNESS_ENV} \
         --create-namespace
       ```

- Use `alpine/helm:3.12.3` as the container image.
- Use `bash` shell and install `yq` inside the container if needed.
- Make sure both steps run inside the same task file.
- The task file should follow Harness Lightspeed task definition format (`kind: task`, `spec.steps` etc).
